Developer documentation
=======================

SmartHomeNG [#f1]_ is a software that serves a basis for home automation.
It interconnects multiple devices using plugins to access their specific interfaces.

This documentation reflects the current Release |release|.

What can be done?
The door bell switch triggers a sensor that signals is changed state to SmartHomeNG. In turn
the TV set is muted and lights are switched on in the hallway. Or being absent an email is sent
to the home owner to announce a visitor and a picture or the door camera is attached to it.

The main documentation here within the code and all READMEs are kept in English.
