Modules for use with plugins
============================

There are loadable modules (SmartHomeNG modules) that can be used when developing plugins.
They implement additional functionality that is not implemented in the core itself.

Modules are configured in etc/modules.yaml. The parameters are described in the README.md
files of the modules
