===================================
Release 1.4.1 - December 23rd, 2017
===================================

There are some bugfixes and new features for the core of SmartHomeNG and the plugins.


Supported Python versions
=========================

Please note: Starting from SmartHomeNG Release 1.4 we cease the active support of older Python
versions. The oldest supported Python version will be Python 3.4.
(See *Hard- & Software Requirements* in section *Installation* for supported Python versions)

This does not necessarily mean that SmartHomeNG as of Release 1.4 is no longer running under older
Python versions. It means that SmartHomeNG is no longer tested with older Python versions and
reported errors with older Python versions are no longer fixed.


Absolute minimum Python versions raised to 3.3
==============================================

The minimum Python version on which SmartHomeNG starts has been increased in SmartHomeNG v1.4 from
3.2 to 3.3. By virtue of the major changes between Python 3.2 and 3.3 it has already been
problematic in the past to run SmartHomeNG with plugins in a Python 3.2 environment.


New functions
=============


New functions in the CORE
-------------------------

* Composition of the version string corrected from GIT information
* Items:

  * Casting for **list** s and **dict** s extended so that values of type **str** are cast accordingly (via json.loads)
  * When loading item definitions, the source file name is stored in the item for user-defined items (for display in the backend and for future features)
