Libraries
=========

Aside from the main program which resides in ``bin/smarthome.py`` there are libraries supporting SmartHomeNG. If a library
has requirements for a Python package that is not met by the standard Python installation, it has to be added to the
**requirements.txt** file in the ../lib directory.

The description of the libraries' functions is shown here:
