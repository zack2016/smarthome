## Web Interfaces

For building a web interface for a plugin, SmartHomeNG delivers a set of 3rd party components with the HTTP module. 
For addons, etc. that are delivered with the components, see /modules/http/webif/gstatic folder!

The plugin needs further components, they have to be located in the static folder of the plugin's web interface 
folder (webif).
