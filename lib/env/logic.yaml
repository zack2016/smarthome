    # one can assume to have around 15째 per hour or approximately 1째 every 4 minutes
    # thus it should be fine to calc the sun position with a 240 seconds interval
    # The elevation won't be so fast so the change will be less than 1째 per 4 minutes
    # which is sufficient
    # increase it if it is needed. But be aware that calculation of sun position with ephem takes time
    # especially on raspi 1 or 2
